# 🧠 LSTM Text Suggestion

`Lstm_text_suggestion` is a deep learning-based text prediction system built using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network. It learns from a given text corpus and can intelligently suggest the next word or complete sentences, making it suitable for use cases like:

- ✍️ Smart writing assistants
- 🔮 Predictive text keyboards
- 📚 Personalized content generators

## 📖 About the Project

This project explores the power of **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** and **LSTM cells** for natural language modeling. Given a sequence of words or characters, the model predicts the most probable next token based on its training corpus.

The pipeline includes:
- Text preprocessing and tokenization
- Sequence creation for supervised learning
- Model design and training using Keras/TensorFlow
- Text generation with adjustable creativity (temperature)

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Character- or word-level LSTM-based text prediction
- 🔁 Sequence modeling with sliding window approach
- 🧪 Adjustable prediction creativity via temperature parameter
- 🧠 Trained on a customizable corpus (e.g., literature, articles, etc.)
- 📝 Command-line interface or Jupyter Notebook usage
- 💬 Supports live input prediction for text typing assistance

## ▶️ Usage

You can train the model and generate predictions from:

### 🔧 Training

```python
# In Jupyter Notebook or Python script:
from model import train_model

train_model(corpus_path='data/text.txt', seq_length=50, epochs=30)
```

### 🧠 Text Prediction

```python
from model import predict_text

predict_text(starting_text="Once upon", num_words=20, temperature=0.8)
```

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Tokenization**: The input corpus is split into sequences of fixed length.
2. **Vectorization**: Each sequence is converted into one-hot encoded or embedded vectors.
3. **Model**: A stacked LSTM network is trained to predict the next word/token.
4. **Sampling**: After training, you can seed the model with a phrase and generate suggestions.
5. **Temperature**: Controls randomness in predictions (lower = conservative, higher = creative).
